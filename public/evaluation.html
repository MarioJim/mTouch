    <h3>Heuristic Evaluation: Nielsen</h3>
    <section id="heuristic">
        <div>
            <p>
                <strong>Visibility of system status:</strong> There is adequate feedback to let the user know on which
                screen they are on both by changing the color of the logo on the nav bar and by showing the name of the
                screen at the top of each page.
            </p>
            <div class="images">

        </div>
        <div>
            <p>
                <strong>Match between system and the real world:</strong> Adequate, all terminology is closely related
                to the Knocki device itself and is understandable by the user. We are considering changing from gestures
                to knocks in order for users to better understand how the device works. We are also considering changing
                the empty dots to dashes to help with the same goal, however we would like to have more tests before
                doing so, as right now results are inconclusive.
            </p>
            <div class="images">

        </div>
        <div>
            <p>
                <strong>User control and freedom:</strong> Adequate control with a nav bar always present that allows
                the user an easy exit from any screen, as well as the ability to delete unwanted touch on gesture
                creation.
            </p>
            <div class="images">

        </div>
        <div>
            <p>
                <strong>Consistency and standards:</strong> Consistent interface, if a word is used to describe
                something, every time that thing is described, the same word is used (such as gestures or devices). We
                also applied standards for logos such as settings and the information that should be displayed on such
                screens.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <p>
                <strong>Error prevention:</strong> A confirmation dialog appears every time a user wants to delete
                either a gesture or a knocki device as well as cancelling the addition of such things.
            </p>
            <div class="images">

        </div>
        <div>
            <p>
                <strong>Recognition rather than recall:</strong> Options when adding devices or gestures are always
                visible and we only use one screen in order to avoid high memory loads.
            </p>
            <div class="images">

        <div>
            <p>
                <strong>Flexibility and efficiency of use:</strong> The addition of toggles to add existing gestures
                directly to new Knocki devices allow more experienced users with many devices to quickly set up all
                their functions, while still providing a great level of customization by selecting which action each
                device is able to perform, and still allowing users to create their own gestures.
            </p>

                <strong>Aesthetic and minimalist design:</strong> We tried our best to design the app properly, without
                any unnecessary information for the functionality required. Only whatever the user needs to accomplish
                is shown.
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors:</strong> All error messages in the app
                are in plain language, really they are only for empty fields, so no error codes are used whatsoever.
            </p>
            <div class="images">

        <div>
            <p>
                <strong>Help and documentation:</strong> There is not a manual or documentation for the user to learn
                how to use the app directly on there, however this would ideally be on the AppStore or Play Store before
                the user downloads the app, or in any case on Knocki’s website. We don’t see why documentation should be
                inside the app.
